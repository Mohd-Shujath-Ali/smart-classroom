# Smart Classroom AI Dashboard 🎓

![Smart Classroom AI](/smart-classroom/assets/placeholder.jpg) <!-- Update this with an actual screenshot from your repo -->

A comprehensive, real-time Computer Vision system and full-stack web dashboard designed for modern educational environments. It uses Yolov8 to actively monitor classroom occupancy, automatically manages energy-consuming appliances (fans & lights) to reduce power waste, and stores historical analytics data for institution-wide auditing.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Occupancy & Quadrant Analysis
- Powered by `Ultralytics YOLOv8`, delivering high-framerate edge inference to detect students.
- Mathematically divides room camera feeds into four distinct zones (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to visualize where students cluster.
- Processes webcam, local `.mp4` video files, or individual `.jpg`/`.png` image uploads with near-zero latency.

### 2. Intelligent Energy Management (Automated Appliances)
- Prevents power waste by linking the live occupant count directly to physical room appliance rules:
  - **0 Students:** 0 Fans, 0 Lights _(Energy Saving Standby)_
  - **1–10 Students:** 2 Fans, 4 Lights _(Low Power Mode)_
  - **11–19 Students:** 4 Fans, 6 Lights _(Medium Power Mode)_
  - **20+ Students:** 6 Fans, 8 Lights _(Maximum Cooling Mode)_
- The unified web dashboard immediately visually glows and re-adjusts as these thresholds are dynamically crossed.

### 3. Persistent Analytics Backend (SQLite + CSV Export)
- Employs a thread-safe custom SQLite memory buffer utilizing Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to record hundreds of detection metrics without lagging the video feed.
- Every detection session isolates its timestamps, peak human counts, and total processed frames.
- **Data Export:** Administrators can export the rolling 24-hour analytics direct to a spreadsheet via the **"Download CSV"** button, and visually embed the tracking chart using the **"Download Graph"** capability.

### 4. Interactive Web Dashboard
- Built using **Flask**, **Flask-SocketIO**, and raw modern CSS styling.
- Secure, lightning-fast websocket connections bypass network bottlenecks, streaming inference logic independent of the visual MJPEG video stream.

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Dashboard Controls (Top bar):** 
   Select your source ranging from `Webcam`, `Video File`, to uploading an `Image`.
2. **Video Playback:** If you selected a Video File, quickly type out the absolute path (e.g. `inputs/sample.mp4`) and hit **Start**.
3. **Automated Tracking:** As the models runs, watch the right-side quadrant counts, total count, and Automated Appliances immediately react to what is visually occurring on the video feed.
4. **Export Findings:** Scoll down to the **Historical Database Data** card to review institutional statistics. Hit the "⬇ CSV" button to download a spreadsheet report.
